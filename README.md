# Google Translate BFBB Rewrite

This C# console app runs BFBB through Google Translate X amount of times. It is a rewrite of a Python version of this app that was written very incorrectly and ignored the complexities of the TEXT file format. This version is still a bit scuffed, but way less than the previous attempt.

## Building

## Contributing
